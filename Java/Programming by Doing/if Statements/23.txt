//else if is saying if the first statement is not true then try this other statement.  If the second statement 
// is not true, then the code inside the else brackets is going to run.

//When the else is removed from the first else if statement it results on printing an extra line that says "we 
//can't decide." This is because the second if is acting as being a new one and the else is acting as if it's
//with the second if.  Either the code in the if prints or the code in the else brackets prints.
