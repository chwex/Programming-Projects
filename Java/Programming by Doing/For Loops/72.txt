//1. if the code is changed to <= an error occurs because the number of characters does not equal the number that is needed
//   to inspect the typed string since that number starts at 0.
//2. if the string box is typed, its length() would be 3 and the position of the last character is 2.
//3. because length() needs to start at one and charAt() starts at 0.
