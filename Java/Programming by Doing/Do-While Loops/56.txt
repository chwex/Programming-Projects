// 1. Gallant and Goofus swim for the same time which is 4 minutes.  
// 2. Gallant does not swim and Goofus swims for a minute.
// 3. Seems like Gallant checks the temperature first.
// 4. Goofus just jumps in the water and swims.
// 5. The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that a while loops first checks for exceptions 
//    then runs the code inside the loop and the do-while loop first runs the code inside the loop then, starts
//    to look for exceptions.
// 6. The "pre-test" loop is the do while loop since it first runs the code inside the loop and the "post-test"
//    loop is the while loop since it runs the code after the exceptions.
